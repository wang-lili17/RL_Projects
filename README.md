#  Reinforcement Learning Projects

Welcome to my Reinforcement Learning (RL) repository. This repository contains collection of projects, experiments, and notes inspired by the classic textbook **"Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction"** by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto (2nd Edition).

Whether you're a student, researcher, or enthusiast, you'll find clear implementations of foundational RL concepts here‚Äîeach with the aim of making complex algorithms more accessible and understandable.

### Key Highlights

-  **Readable and documented** Python implementations  
-  **Educational focus** ‚Äî great for self-study  
-  **Experiments** to reinforce theoretical concepts

##  Projects Implemented So Far

| Project                           | Description |
|----------------------------------|-------------|
| [‚ùå‚≠ï **Tic Tac Toe**](https://github.com/wang-lili17/RL_Projects/tree/main/tic-tac-toe) | A simple game for implementing value functions and policy evaluation. |
| [üé∞ **Ten-Armed Testbed**](https://github.com/wang-lili17/RL_Projects/tree/main/ten-armed-testbed) | A classic bandit problem to explore strategies like Œµ-greedy and UCB. |
| [üß± **Gridworld with MDP**](https://github.com/wang-lili17/RL_Projects/tree/main/gridworld-mdp) | A Markov Decision Process-based environment to understand states and rewards. |
| [üßÆ **Gridworld with Dynamic Programming**](https://github.com/wang-lili17/RL_Projects/tree/main/gridworld-dp) | Using Policy Evaluation, Policy Iteration, and Value Iteration to solve Gridworld. |
| [ü™ô **Gambler‚Äôs Problem**](https://github.com/wang-lili17/RL_Projects/tree/main/gambler-problem) | A coin tossing game where the gambler aims to reach 100 dollars using value iteration. |
